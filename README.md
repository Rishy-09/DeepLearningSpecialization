# Deep Learning Specialization — Assignments

This repository contains my completed Jupyter Notebook assignments from the **Deep Learning Specialization**. The notebooks cover both fundamental concepts and practical implementations in deep learning.

## Contents

* Neural Networks & Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models

## Highlights & Learning Notes

* Implemented forward and backward propagation from scratch, which helped me deeply understand how neural networks learn.
* Learned how hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, regularization, batch size) drastically affects performance.
* Explored CNNs for image classification and RNNs/LSTMs for sequence prediction tasks.
* Faced common issues like:

  * Gradient vanishing/exploding problems in deep networks
  * Shape mismatches when working with matrices and tensors
  * Overfitting due to small datasets

## Tools & Frameworks

* Python, NumPy
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Matplotlib for visualization
* OpenCV for image tasks

## Notes

* Model weights (`.h5`) are managed using Git LFS due to size limits.
* These notebooks serve as a practical reference for deep learning fundamentals and common pitfalls beginners face.
